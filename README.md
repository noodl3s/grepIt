grepIt README.md

This is just a simple search script for bash shell.  Simple is the goal. However, I do want to add more features (with a menu) while keeping it simple at the same time: I want to be able to search for words without having to go through a list of questions for each search.

I know this is an easy script to write, and I'm sure there are plenty of similar scripts out there like this. But, I am just 'noodling' around with git and GitHub, while to trying to give back a little (maybe someone else can benefit from this). 

I will add more commits once I find the time to do so.

Things I want to include (so far): a menu, an -ri grep option, simpler portability for other users...
